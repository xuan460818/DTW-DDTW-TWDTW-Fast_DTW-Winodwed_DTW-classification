# DTW-DDTW-TWDTW-Fast_DTW-Winodwed_DTW-classification
The file based on DTW and four improved algorithms baesd on DTW, then proposed two ways to extract space infomation in  remote image time series
## Instruction
1. All of the description of DTW(Dynamic Time Warping), DDTW(Derivative Dynamic Time Warping), TWDTW(Time Weighted Dynamic Time Warping), Fast-DTW(Fast Dynamic Time Warping) and Windowed-DTW(Windowed Dynamic Time Warping) are in the fill classification.cpp
2. File expand_dimension.cpp contains two ways to extract space information in remote image time series.
3. File file_related.cpp contains all steps about data preprocessing, such as getting time series and loading data

## Notice
Main.cpp contains codes realize k-NN.
